# Workflow State: render-the-removal-assessment-as-a-report

> State file, not a procedure — stages live in the asimov-plan/build/archive skills.
> Source of truth: gates → this file · task completion → `tasks.md`
> States: `[ ]` pending · `[x]` done · `[-]` skipped/N/A · `[!]` failed non-blocking

## Plan

- [ ] Gate 1: direction approved _(only if a real fork; else `[-]`)_
- [ ] `asm change validate` passes
- [x] Gate 2: plan approved

## Implement

- [x] All tasks done (`tasks.md`)
- [x] Verify gate: type check / lint / test observed passing _(`[-]` per command not in project.md)_
- [ ] Review done _(user-initiated; `[-]` + reason if skipped)_
- [ ] Gate: implementation approved
- [ ] Blueprint sync complete _(`[-]` + reason only when `Blueprint: none`)_

## Archive

- [ ] Apply deltas: `bun run asm change apply`
- [ ] Archive change: `bun run asm change archive`

> Commit everything after archive. No box: `archive` ticks its own before the commit exists, and a tick is evidence — git history is the record here.

## Notes

<!-- Blueprint source, lane, and the SHA the plan is written against below. Optional: one-line orphan decisions only — scope boundaries, deviations, rejected alternatives with no home elsewhere. -->

Blueprint: docs/PLAN.md task WT-013.4
Lane: full (standard) — MEDIUM risk: presentation only, but it decides what a user is told before authorizing an irreversible deletion, and retires an existing safety guard | flags: none
Planned at: cf4492aa
- Worktree based on huybuidac/create-worktree-harden, not main: WT-013.1 and WT-013.2 are the deps and neither is merged to main yet — main's docs/PLAN.md has no WT-013 tasks at all and src/worktree has no orphan proofs. A first attempt on the default base was discarded before any work landed.
- No new-api-contract flag: WT-013.1 and WT-013.2 already carry `cls`, the four-outcome vocabulary and the three proofs in the same checks array, so this change alters no message shape.
- 1_2 leaves a residual D2/D3 composed: a REFUSAL-class check that is `unproven` no longer withholds anything (`isRefusedByChecks` refuses only on `failed`), so it falls to the confirmable classes — typed if one of those is failing or unproven, ordinary otherwise. Both the spec's "Otherwise ... ordinary" and D2 say this explicitly, so it is built as accepted; flagged here because the retired guard was the only thing covering it and review should see it named rather than infer it.
- Verify Gate: 3 biome errors / 14 warnings / 1 info is the pre-existing baseline on this branch (src/agentHooks, src/cursor, src/vault, CSS files) — none in this change's files, reproduced unchanged before and after.
- 1_3 needed no spec delta: `A removal states what it destroys and what it spares` is already a BASELINE worktree-panel requirement and is written for "a removal confirmation", unqualified. A mid-build handback was raised against the delta alone and withdrawn once the baseline was read.
- Cycle 1 round 1 (discovery) returned BLOCK: B1, B2 accepted as blockers, W1, W2 accepted as warnings — triage in .reviews/round-1.md. No fix loop was opened: B1 and W1 both require artifact handbacks, and B1's is product scope, which fastlane never auto-chooses. B2 and W2 are fixable inside the accepted contract and are held so they are not built on a control B1 may cut. PARKED awaiting the user's scope call.
- W1 supersedes the 1_2 residual noted above: docs/DESIGN.md D43 already decided that a hard refusal unproven still refuses, so this change's D2 contradicts the blueprint rather than merely leaving a gap. D2 must be re-earned, not patched.
